# incubator-controller
incubator controller with seven segments and dht22

the current project contains 2 PCB files which have been designed by proteus 8.5
the file "up PCB" is designation of controller(main) part, which contains microcontroller(ATmega8), seven-segments and control keys.
the file "down PCB" contains input power-supply port and I/O ports for sensors and actuator relays.
also, this system needs an additional power supply for working. a 12V/2A switching adaptor is suggested.
